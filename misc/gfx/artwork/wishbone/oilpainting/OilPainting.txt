These images have been made using Paint.NET. Here is what I did:

1. Choose a motive from the original graphics.

2. Clean up the motive, if necessary, removing the background.

3. Scale up the motive, using interpolation, so the result is somewhat blurry, rather than pixellated.

4. Apply an Oil Painting filter, fiddling around with the parameters until it looks good.

I just did these for fun. I don't think they can be used for the game itself, but they might make good website graphics.
