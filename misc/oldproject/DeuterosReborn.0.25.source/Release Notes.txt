Although there has been little activity on the forums, I still work on the code. 

Version 0.3 (Build XXXX)
Download here: [url]http://www.borkovec.com/jirka/Deuteros.0.30.zip[/url]
Release notes:
+ fix: added delay before starting item production
+ fix: added current time to save/load game
- Research
+ Star/planet/moon data
+ Mining (incomplete interface)

Next version (0.4) will feature additional:
- Training
- Custom filesystem interface

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Long time, no update. I'm busy! And sick :) but I still manage to work around 30-60 minutes per day,
so some outcomes do exist - and the one today is... Version 0.2 :) 

Version 0.2 (Build 2745)
Download here: [url]http://www.borkovec.com/jirka/Deuteros.0.20.zip[/url]
Release notes:
+ Production interface (to see the AOC version of the interface just 
	transfer to orbital using the runtime editor)
+ Storeroom interface
+ Load GuiButtonInfo from ModGui.fdrm
+ Save GuiButtonInfo to ModGui.fdrm
+ Load gui from ModGui.fdrm
+ Load game from Xml
+ Runtime editor - Item template support
+ Load item templates from Xml
+ Save item templates to Xml
+ Textures now really do load from mod info (GuiTextures.fdrt)
+ Mod information loads from GameInfo.fdri
+ Fonts load from Fonts.fdrf
* Lots of invisible stuff as always :) (well, not really. Much more than always :) )
* From now on, all the files are to be backwards compatible (if possible. If not, there will be
   a conversion utility or info on how to make it work in new version). And I keep a version-changelist

Next version (0.3) will feature additional:
- Research
- Star/planet/moon data
- Mining
- I should finally get active enough to implement some sort of "strings file" to limit
	hardcoded messages to minimum, but that doesn't necessarily have to be in the next
	version

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

You say, what was I working on for the past few days? (Well, Dex has an idea probably... though I did some programming as well :razz: )
I released this before the 0.2 version, because I'm leaving for two or three days to write an exam
(and thus hopefully getting a study place on university) and I didn't want you to think I gave up :) 

150kB of code, 4.000 code lines (and 1.400 lines of comments :razz: )

Version 0.19 (Build 2716)
Download here: [url]http://www.borkovec.com/jirka/Deuteros.0.19.zip[/url]
Release notes:
- STILL NO FromXml FUNCTIONS!
* Reworked the item production architecture (can be seen in the data files)
+ Removed a lot of hardcoded things about gui (getting quite close to the final moddable gui)
+ Added future support for more user fonts (bitmap or system based - does only handle system ones at the moment)
+ Loading textures using mod data
+ Support for user items and their production line
+ Storage functionality coded and half of the interface as well
+ Production now takes and gives :) (you can watch it in the savegames as well)

Next version (0.2) will feature additional:
- Production interface
- Load those Xml datafiles :) 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

And we have new release there :) The code grows, right now it has over 126kB. That's like 130.000 characters :razz: And it will grow way further  

Version 0.15 (Build 2711) 
Download here: http://www.borkovec.com/jirka/Deuteros.0.15.zip 
Release notes: 
+ animated icon support  
+ ingame cursor 
+ AdvanceTime now works when holding mouse on clock 
+ complete station architecture (thanks god) 
+ production functionality (watch the console, still missing the interface and stores  ) 
+ it is now possible to save a game 
+ added moddability support (though the game is still too small to make much difference  ). To run another mod just add param "-mod<mod_name>" to the command line 
+ the unique runtime editor  To activate, run the game with param "-editor". Recommended resolution 1280x1024 and more  
+ added WorkTeams and their architecture 
+ added Materials and very little of their architecture 

Next version (0.2) will feature additional: 
- Station storages and their interface 
- Complete production cycle (ie adding consumption and storage) 
- Production interface 
- Loading textures using mod data instead of hardcoding 
- Load game 
- Load mod info

Heya  
I thought it might be a nice idea to make "nightly" code builds ready for any other dev to test/see. So, starting today... Ladies and gentlemen... please, welcome the Deuteros Reborn, version 0.07 *clap* *clap* 

Deuteros Reborn, version 0.07 (Build 2710) 
Download here: http://www.borkovec.com/jirka/Deuteros.0.07.zip (80.230B) 
Release notes: 
+ hooray, a nice working interface  I know may make any button visible/nonvisible, clicking a button does really change the current screen (just there's no code for any screen yet  ). The Advance Time feature does work - though it just increments the clock as of yet... there's no ships nor colonies, so... 
+ menu (press esc). Probably will just be used internally... love the Deuteros original menus  
+ lots of architecture done 

Next version (0.1) lacks the following features: 
- animated icons 
- ingame cursor (not the windows one) 

Well, that's it for today  Hope the graphics guy is gonna show up with some neato new icons and interface graphics... though I must admit, I like the old graphics  Feel free to comment the work
